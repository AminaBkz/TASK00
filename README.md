# Animal Dataset Preparation - Python task

This repository contains my implementation of the first part of a dataloader assignment , which is inspired by 'torch.utils.data.Dataset'

# Task Description
Download 20 images each of cats, dogs and horses, organized them into a structured dataset folder.

So after importing the images , I created a Python script that:
  -Takes the path to a dataset folder
  -Rename all image files to a consistent format.

# Video walkthrough
  I recorded two screen recordings showing my implementation.
